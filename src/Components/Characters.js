        <p>Characters: Jen, Luke</p>
        Jen is a neighbor of Luke. She is a shadow child. Luke will frequently,
        secretly travel between his house and Jen's. Jen is a tenacious
        character. Luke says stopping jen is like "trying to stop the sun," ().
        Jen is trying to start a rally. Jen is trying to gather thousands of
        shadow children to protest the population law. The population law is a
        law that limits each family to only have two children. Jen is organizing
        this rally because she is a shadow child and wants to live a life with
        freedom. After months of planning Jen goes to the rally. Luke doesn't go
        with her because he is to afraid that he might get hurt. When Jen gets
        to the rally she is killed. Barely any shadow kids went to the rally.
        "'I think at first she thought the rally would work.' Luke told Jen's
        Dad. 'And then, even when she wasn't sure... she still had to go. She
        wouldn't call it off.'" Luke says. Even though Jen wasn't sure or maybe
        even knew that the rally wouldn't work, she still tried instead of doing
        nothing. This forms the theme because she couldn't just do nothing. She
        had do to try to at least gain her freedom. Luke can understand a
        situation well. Luke has been exposed to many different points of view.
        He was exposed to the Barons', Jen's, government's his parents', and
        Jen's Dad point of view. This developed Luke's character throughout the
        story as he learned different character's point of views. Jen's Dad
        works for the population police. The population police are government
        workers who enforce the population law. After Jen's death Jen's Dad
        meets Luke. After learning Luke was friends with Jen, Jen's Dad offers
        Luke a fake I.D. A fake I.D. is a permanent way of changing a shadow
        child's identity. Changing their identity can allow them to explore the
        world without having the risk of getting caught by the population
        police. Luke accepts the fake I.D. In Among the Hidden it states "But he
        wanted to do something. He remembered what he'd told Jen, the last he'd
        seen her: 'It's people like you who change history'". In this quote Luke
        wants to do something. He wants a fake I.D to do something. He knows he
        can't do anything if he hides for the rest of his life. He wants to stop
        the population law. This forms the theme because Luke needs to do
        something about the population law. He gets a fake I.D just so he can
        just do something and not do nothing.
