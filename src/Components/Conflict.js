        Conflict: Luke is trying to explore and live in the outside world. Luke
        is the third child in a family. In among the hidden a family having more
        than two children is illegal. Third children in a family are called
        shadow children. Luke spends his whole life inside his family's house.
        Since he is a shadow child, his identity has to be hidden from the
        government. Luke rarely gets to go outside, go to school, use the
        internet, or do anything that can risk his identity being found. This
        causes the conflict of the story. Luke is tired of being hidden and
        wants to explore the outside world. He doesn't like being hidden and
        wants to escape. Luke thinks he saw a shadow child at a window in a
        neighboring house. Luke can't be sure at all if the child is a third
        child. Luke wonders if the third child could understand him. Nobody can
        understand Luke's conflict. Luke thinks about to taking a risk and
        running to the house where he thought there was another shadow child.
        Luke thinks to himself "Maybe today. Do I dare?" (). He isn't sure
        wether he should go or not. Luke ends up running to the house where he
        thinks there is a shadow child. This forms the theme because Luke is
        taking a risk. Luke was raised to fear going outside. His whole entire
        life he has to hide his identity. If he gets caught he will get himself
        and his family in trouble. He still takes a risk to go outside and run
        to the other house only because he thinks there is a shadow child living
        there. He wants to do something rather than hide for the rest of his
        life.
